# SpotifyDataDashboard
Deploys a website which displays a dashboard filled with stats from my personal Spotify listening history. 


Think of this project as my own personal version of Spotify Wrapped, except I get to see my monthly progress and customize which stats I want to see. The website automatically updates as well, so I simply have to look up the website to see my (mostly) updated spotify data.
